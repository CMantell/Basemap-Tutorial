This is a work in progress tutorial that I wrote for teaching how to use the Basemap library from matplotlib.toolkits (mpl_toolkits).  This tutorial goes over many very basic concepts relating to geography and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) such as projections.  

The overall goal of is tutorial is to give a user knowledge of how to use Basemap's methods for the purpose of using this library for some basic geospatial analysis and visualizations.  While there are other programs available for doing geospatial analysis (Ex: ArcGIS, QGIS), I wanted to see if I can do and teach basic GIS skills in strictly a Python environment without getting too caught up in the details.  Hopefully this Jupyter notebook tutorial has an easy to understand flow and users learn something.

Part of the overall scheme of this tutorial was influenced by the Basemap tutorial found here: https://basemaptutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

My ideal teaching schema for this tutorial:

> 1. Map Making - Coordinates, Map Extent, and Resolution (Done)
> 2. Projections (Done)
> 3. Adding XY data
> 4. Using Shapefiles (Need to find process to easily change projected coordinate systems into geographic coordinate systems)
> 5. Accessing Shapefile Attributes
> 6. Selecting Locations Based on Attributes
